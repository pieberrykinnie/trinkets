# Instructions

`Main.java` is a program that tests whether the `traverse()` method in `LinkedList.java` is implemented correctly.

Your task is to implement the `traverse()` method found in `LinkedList.java`, which should print the list's contents in both forward and reverse order. Then, run `Main.java` to compare your output with the sample output.
