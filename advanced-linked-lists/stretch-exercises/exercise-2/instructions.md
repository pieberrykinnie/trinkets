# Instructions

In this exercise, you'll implement in-place reversal for both circular and doubly-linked lists. This is a fundamental operation that requires careful pointer manipulation.

Your task is to implement the `reverse` method in both `CircularList.java` and `DoublyLinkedList.java`. The reversal should be done in-place, meaning you should modify the existing list structure rather than creating a new one.

You'll need to handle various edge cases including empty lists and single-node lists. Run `ReverseDemo.java` to test your implementations with different scenarios.
