# Instructions

In this exercise, you'll implement a method to rotate a circular list by N positions. This operation is useful in many applications, such as implementing circular buffers or rotating displays.

Your task is to implement the `rotate` method in `RotatableList.java` that efficiently rotates the list by N positions. A positive N means rotating clockwise (moving elements to the right), while a negative N means rotating counterclockwise (moving elements to the left).

The challenge is to implement this efficiently without traversing the entire list multiple times. Run `RotationDemo.java` to test your implementation with various rotation values and list sizes.
