# Instructions

In this exercise, you'll implement a browser history navigation system using a doubly-linked list. This models how web browsers maintain a history of visited pages and allow users to navigate backward and forward.

Your task is to implement the missing methods in `BrowserHistory.java` to create a functioning browser history system. Then, run `BrowserDemo.java` to test your implementation and see how it simulates a user's navigation through web pages.
