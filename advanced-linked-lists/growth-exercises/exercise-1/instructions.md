# Instructions

In this exercise, you'll implement a music playlist system using a doubly-linked list. `PlaylistManager.java` contains a partially implemented playlist manager that allows users to add songs, navigate forward and backward through songs, and manage a music playlist.

Your task is to implement the missing methods in `MusicPlaylist.java` to create a fully functioning doubly-linked playlist. Then, run `PlaylistDemo.java` to test your implementation and see how it behaves as a digital music player.
