# Advanced Linked Lists

## Growth Level

### Objectives

1. Practice with creating, adding and removing nodes from doubly-linked lists
2. Practice with creating, adding and removing nodes from circular lists.

### Exercise 1: Music Playlist

In this exercise, you'll implement a music playlist system using a doubly-linked list. This models how digital music players manage song playback, allowing users to navigate both forward and backward through a list of songs.

You'll practice:
- Building a doubly-linked list structure
- Implementing navigation through a list in both directions
- Adding and removing nodes from the middle of a list
- Handling edge cases when the list is empty or at boundaries

The resulting playlist manager will allow you to add songs, play the next or previous song, and remove songs from the playlist.

### Exercise 2: Round-Robin Process Scheduler

In this exercise, you'll implement a simple round-robin process scheduler using a circular linked list. This models how operating systems might allocate CPU time to different processes in a fair manner.

You'll practice:
- Creating and managing a circular linked list
- Implementing rotation through a circular structure
- Removing nodes from a circular list
- Adding new nodes to a circular structure

The scheduler will allow you to add processes with different priorities and execution times, and simulate how an operating system would cycle through them, allocating time slices to each.

### Exercise 3: Browser History Navigation

In this exercise, you'll implement a browser history navigation system using a doubly-linked list. This models how web browsers maintain a history of visited pages and allow users to navigate backward and forward.

You'll practice:
- Creating a doubly-linked list for navigation in both directions
- Implementing forward and backward traversal
- Truncating a portion of the list (forward history) when visiting a new page
- Managing references between nodes

The browser history system will allow you to visit new pages, navigate back and forward through your browsing history, and handle the special case of branching history when visiting a new page from the middle of your history.
